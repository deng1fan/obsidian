Considering some authors prefer publishing longer papers, we allow authors to submit up to 16 pages for regular papers, up to 10 pages for short papers/industrial papers. However, we do not encourage authors to submit overlength papers due to the over length charge. Refer to the following instructions for detailed information about the over length charge:

• **Full papers** should be submitted electronically in PDF and be ==**12 pages**==. We allow 4 more extra pages with extra page fees, total max paper length is 16 pages with extra fees. Please use the Springer LNCS style as described in [https://www.springer.com/us/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines](https://www.springer.com/us/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)

• **Short papers** are also accepted. Short papers are expected to be **8 pages**, including all text, figures, references and appendices.We allow 2 more extra pages with extra page fees, total max paper length is 10 pages with extra fees.

We also encourage the submission of visionary paper and survey paper, which is belong to type 1.

Important Note: Counting the cost of the over length charge uses the longest submission version (e.g. submission version, updated version, camera-ready version). The purpose of this policy is to save reviewers’ time and our operation time.

The scope of KSEM 2023 covers a broad extent including ==knowledge science, knowledge engineering, and knowledge management.== The conference is gathering all high-quality research/industrial papers related to ==parallel computing== and ==smart computing== and targets at proposing a reference guideline for further research.
