title: Tips
简称 INS，对语言要求极高。对论文的要求如描述，格式，方法和实验的细节也很严谨。 但在小领域match度上就个人收到的意见而言不如KBS。
摘要最多二百字

## 写作模板

As a guideline: experimental manuscripts should not be longer than ==40 double-spaced== typed pages and ==8 figures + tables==; for theoretical manuscripts a maximum of 45 pages and 10 figures + tables is suggested.

All manuscripts should be concisely written, stressing the motivation for, and the novel aspects of, the work. Contributions should contain an Abstract (of ==up to 200 words==) and a Conclusions section, which particularly in the case of theoretical papers translates the results into terms readily accessible to most readers.
