## **Topics of Interest**

We encourage submissions of high-quality research papers on all topics in the general areas of artificial intelligence, data science, databases, information retrieval, and knowledge management. Topics of interest include, but ==are not limited to==, the following areas:

-   Data and information acquisition and preprocessing (e.g., data crawling, IoT data, data quality, data privacy, mitigating biases, data wrangling)
-   Integration and aggregation (e.g., semantic processing, data provenance, data linkage, data fusion, knowledge graphs, data warehousing, privacy and security, modeling, information credibility)
-   Efficient data processing (e.g., serverless, data-intensive computing, database systems, indexing and compression, architectures, distributed data systems, dataspaces, customized hardware)
-   Special data processing (e.g., multilingual text, sequential, stream, spatio-temporal, (knowledge) graphs, multimedia, scientific, and social media data)
-   Analytics and machine learning (e.g., OLAP, data mining, machine learning and AI, scalable analysis algorithms, algorithmic biases, event detection and tracking, understanding, interpretability)
-   Neural Information and knowledge processing (e.g., graph neural networks, domain adaptation, transfer learning, network architectures, neural ranking, neural recommendation, and neural prediction)
-   Information access and retrieval (e.g., ad hoc and web search, facets and entities, question answering and dialogue systems, retrieval models, query processing, personalization, recommender and filtering systems)
-   Users and interfaces for information and data systems (e.g., user behavior analysis, user interface design, perception of biases, personalization, interactive information retrieval, interactive analysis, spoken interfaces)
-   Evaluation, performance studies, and benchmarks (e.g., online and offline evaluation, best practices)
-   Crowdsourcing (e.g. task assignment, worker reliability, optimization, trustworthiness, transparency, best practices)
-   Understanding multi-modal content (e.g., natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, content understanding, knowledge extraction, knowledge graphs, and knowledge representations)
-   Data presentation (e.g., visualization, summarization, readability, VR, speech input/output)
-   Applications (e.g., urban systems, biomedical and health informatics, legal informatics, crisis informatics, computational social science, data-enabled discovery, social media)

## **Paper Submissions**

Authors are invited to submit original full-length research papers that are not previously published, accepted to be published, or being considered for publication in any other forum. Full-length papers should satisfy the standard requirements of top-tier international research conferences.

Manuscripts using the ACM sigconf template, see [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). Submissions should be in ==2-column sigconf format==. ==Full papers cannot exceed 9 pages plus unlimited references==. Rejected full papers will not be considered for publication as short papers. **Paper review will be double blind, and those submissions that have not been properly anonymized will be desk-rejected without review.** ==At least one author of each accepted paper must register to present the work as scheduled in the conference program==, which may include both oral presentations and poster sessions. Additional details for running the online conference will be published on the website shown above.

## **Dual Submission Policy**

It is not allowed to submit papers that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences (or any venue with published proceedings). Such submissions violate our dual-submission policy. There are several exceptions to this rule:

-   Submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published.
-   Submission is permitted for papers that have previously been made available as a technical report or similar, e.g., in arXiv. In this case, the authors should not cite the report, so as to preserve anonymity.

## **ACM Policy Against Discrimination**

All authors and participants must adhere the the ACM discrimination policy. For full details, please visit this site:

As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies https://www.acm.org/publications/policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects)
