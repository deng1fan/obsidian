## Paper Types and Formats

Long papers must describe substantial, original, completed, and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited pages of references and appendices. Final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to nine (9) pages), so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.

Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead, short papers should have a small, focused contribution - a point that can be made in a few pages with sufficient level of detail. Short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus unlimited pages of references and appendices. Final versions of short papers will be given one additional page of content (up to five (5) pages), so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.

Both short and long papers are submitted through the same process, but they will be reviewed using a different review form and criteria. Short and long papers will be distinguished in the proceedings, but the length of the paper does not correspond to either the final presentation format (poster or oral), or the type of contribution made in the paper.

## Paper Submission and Templates

Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system. Both long and short papers must follow the ACL ==two-column format, using the supplied official style files.== The templates can be downloaded in [Style Files and Formatting](https://2023.aclweb.org/calls/style_and_formatting/). **Please do not modify these style files, nor should you use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.**

To guarantee conformance to publication standards, we will be using the [ACL Pubcheck tool](https://github.com/acl-org/aclpubcheck). The PDFs of camera-ready papers must be run through this tool prior to their final submission, and we recommend its use also at submission time.
